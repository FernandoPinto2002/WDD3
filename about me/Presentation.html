        <h2>Fernando Pinto</h2>
        <body>Hello there! My name is Fernando pinto and I am excited to be in this class,
            <br> I was born in Peru, my Dad is a economist and my Mom is a chef which is pretty cool and got a lot of perks with it.
            <br> I grew in the district called "La Molina", a peaceful and friendly neighborhood which I loved.
            <br> I started to like programming before my mission and did a small course about python. 
            <br> My expectations for this course is to learn from all of you since I believe I am new to this programming world
            <br> Also I like basketball, watching NBA and trying new things!
