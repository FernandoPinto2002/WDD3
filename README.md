I am a sophomore at BYU-Idaho, pursuing a degree in Software Engineering with a focus on full-stack web development. My passionis based on creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications, combining creativity and technical skills to deliver impactful solutions.

I have experience with Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am currently expanding my expertise by learning React. My journey in web development began with front-end classes I completed through CERTUS in Peru, which gave me a solid foundation in crafting responsive and visually appealing interfaces.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I bring professional experience as a custodian at the BYU-Idaho Center and currently work as an Email Specialist for BYU-Idaho. These roles have helped me develop a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and the ability to adapt and excel in various environments.

So far, I created projects like a cooking book organizer, a small web shop with a shopping cart, basic webpages with interactive features. I am willing to know and learn more ideas for projects!

I am eager to connect with professionals in the tech industry, collaborate on innovative projects, and continue growing as a full-stack developer. Feel free to reach out—I’m always excited to learn and exchange ideas!
